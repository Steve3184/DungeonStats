*   **Foster Competition:** Display dynamic leaderboards in your world using floating text (holograms) to show off the top players.
*   **Engage Your Community:** Players can check their own stats or compare themselves against the server's best.
*   **Provide Developer Tools:** A built-in RESTful API allows you to pull stats for use on websites, Discord bots, or other custom integrations.

## üîå RESTful API Documentation

If `api-server.enabled` is set to `true`, the plugin will host a simple API server on the configured port. **This discloses game data to a remote server connection and must be firewalled appropriately if you do not want it to be public.**
